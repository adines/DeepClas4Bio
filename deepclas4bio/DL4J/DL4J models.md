# DL4J models

Here you can find the pretrained models for the DL4J framework. In the following table the information of the model, the model structure and the pretrained weights can be found.

To include a new model in the API you have to save the model structure and place it in *HOMEPATH/DeepClas4BioModels/DL4J/Classification/model/modelName.zip*  and save the weights and place it in *HOMEPATH/DeepClas4BioModels/DL4J/Classification/weights/modelName.zip*.

## Pretrained models
The list of the pretrained models are the following.
